# Prime-Factors

This project contains a python program that performs some mathematical operations using prime factors.

## Features

### 1. Prime Factorization
The `get_prime_factors(num)` function calculates and returns the prime factors of a given integer.

### 2. Prime Number Check
The `is_prime(num)` function checks and return boolean if a given integer num is a prime number.

### 3. Greatest Common Divisor
The `gcd(num1, num2)` function calculates the greatest common divisor of two integers using the Euclidean algorithm.

## How It Works
The program runs an infinite loop in the main function where the user can choose one of the three operations:

**Prime Factors**: Prompts the user to input a number and then displays its prime factors.
**Is Prime**: Prompts the user to input a number and checks if it is a prime number.
**Greatest Common Divisor**: Prompts the user to input two numbers and calculates their GCD.
The user can exit the program by choosing the option 0.
