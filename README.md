# Prime-Factors

This project contains a python program that performs some mathematical operations using prime factors.

## Features

### 1. Prime Factorization
The `get_prime_factors(num)` function calculates and returns a list of prime factors of a given integer.

### 2. Prime Number Check
The `is_prime(num)` function checks and returns boolean if a given integer num is a prime number.

### 3. Greatest Common Divisor
The `gcd(num1, num2)` function calculates and returns the greatest common divisor of two integers using the Euclidean algorithm.

### 4. Least Common Multiple
The `lcm(num1, num2)` function calculates and returns the least common multiple of two integers.

### 5. Positive Divisors
The `positive_divisors(num1)` function calculates and returns a list of positive divisors of given integer.

### 6. Coprime Number
The `euler_totient(num1)` function calculates and returns the number of smaller relatively prime numbers with given integer.

## How It Works
The program runs an infinite loop in the main function where the user can choose one of the three operations:

**Prime Factors**: Prompts the user to input a number and then displays its prime factors.<br>
**Is Prime**: Prompts the user to input a number and checks if it is a prime number.<br>
**Greatest Common Divisor**: Prompts the user to input two numbers and calculates their GCD.<br>
**Least Common Multiple**: Prompts the user to input two numbers and calculates their LCM.<br>
**Positive Divisors**: Prompts the user to input a number and then displays its positive divisors.<br>
**Coprime Number**: Promts the user to input a number and then displays number of smaller relatively prime number
The user can exit the program by choosing the option 0.
